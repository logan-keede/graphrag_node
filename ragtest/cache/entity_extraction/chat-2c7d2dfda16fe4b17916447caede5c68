This is the first time a gold medal tie among the two most successful nations has occurred in history.[14] Japan finished third with 20 gold medals and sixth in the overall medal count. Australia finished fourth with 18 gold medals and fifth in the overall medal count. The host nation, France, finished fifth with 16 gold and 64 total medals. Dominica, Saint Lucia, Cape Verde and Albania won their first-ever Olympic medals, the former two both being gold, with Botswana and Guatemala also winning their first-ever gold medals. The Refugee Olympic Team also won their first-ever medal, a bronze in boxing. At the conclusion of the games, despite some controversies throughout relating to politics, logistics and conditions in the Olympic Village, the Games were considered a success by the press and observers.[c]\n\nHost selection\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3-8b-8192", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 3000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
