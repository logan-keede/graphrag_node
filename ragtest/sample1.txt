Medals
The President of the Paris 2024 Olympic Organizing Committee, Tony Estanguet, unveiled the Olympic and Paralympic medals for the Games in February 2024, which on the obverse featured embedded hexagon-shaped tokens of scrap iron that had been taken from the original construction of the Eiffel Tower, with the logo of the Games engraved into it.[40] Approximately 5,084 medals would be produced by the French mint Monnaie de Paris, and were designed by Chaumet, a luxury jewellery firm based in Paris.[41]

The reverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, inside the Panathenaic Stadium which hosted the first modern Olympics in 1896. Parthenon and the Eiffel Tower can also be seen in the background on both sides of the medal.[42] Each medal weighs 455–529 g (16–19 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 9.2 mm (0.36 in) thick.[43] The gold medals are made with 98.8 percent silver and 1.13 percent gold, while the bronze medals are made up with copper, zinc, and tin.[44]

Security
France reached an agreement with Europol and the UK Home Office to help strengthen security and "facilitate operational information exchange and international law enforcement cooperation" during the Games.[45] The agreement included a plan to deploy more drones and sea barriers to prevent small boats from crossing the Channel illegally.[46] The British Army would also provide support by deploying Starstreak surface-to-air missile units for air security.[47] To prepare for the Games, the Paris police held inspections and rehearsals in their bomb disposal unit, similar to their preparations for the 2023 Rugby World Cup at the Stade de France.[48]

As part of a visit to France by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, several agreements were signed between the two nations to enhance security for the Olympics.[49] In preparation for the significant security demands and counterterrorism measures, Poland pledged to contribute security troops, including sniffer dog handlers, to support international efforts aimed at ensuring the safety of the Games.[50][51] The Qatari Minister of Interior and Commander of Lekhwiya (the Qatari security forces) convened a meeting on 3 April 2024 to discuss security operations ahead of the Olympics, with officials and security leaders in attendance, including Nasser Al-Khelaifi and Sheikh Jassim bin Mansour Al Thani.[52] A week before the opening ceremony, the Lekhwiya were reported to have been deployed in Paris on 16 July 2024.[53]

In the weeks running up to the opening of the Paris Olympics, it was reported that police officers would be deployed from Belgium,[54] Brazil,[55] Canada (through the RCMP/OPP/CPS/SQ),[56][57][58] Cyprus,[59] the Czech Republic,[60] Denmark,[61] Estonia,[62][63] Finland,[64] Germany (through Bundespolizei[65][66]/NRW Police[67]),[68] India,[69][70] Ireland,[71] Italy,[72] Luxembourg,[73] Morocco,[74] Netherlands,[75] Norway,[57] Poland,[76] Portugal,[77] Slovakia,[78] South Korea,[79][80] Spain (through the CNP/GC),[81] Sweden,[82] the UAE,[83] the UK,[48] and the US (through the LAPD[84]/LASD[85]/NYPD[86]/FCPD[87]), with more than 40 countries providing police assistance to their French counterparts.[88][89]

Security concerns impacted the plans that had been announced for the opening ceremony, which was to take place as a public event along the Seine; the expected attendance was reduced by half from an estimated 600,000 to 300,000, with plans for free viewing locations now being by invitation only. In April 2024, after Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Crocus City Hall attack in March, and made several threats against the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, French president Emmanuel Macron indicated that the opening ceremony could be scaled back or re-located if necessary.[90][91][92] French authorities had placed roughly 75,000 police and military officials on the streets of Paris in the lead-up to the Games.[93]

Food
To reduce the environmental impact and climate footprint of the Paris 2024 Games,[94] the Olympic venues served twice as much plant-based food as was available in London in 2012 and Rio in 2016.[95] Vegan chicken nuggets and vegan hot dogs were served in place of the meat-based variety.[96] Venues for spectators served on average two-thirds plant-based meals. The Place de la Concorde, the venue that hosted the skateboarding, breakdancing and BMX events, only served plant-based food. The football stadiums served 40% plant-based food. About 30% of the meals served to athletes in the Olympic Village were plant-based.[97]

A prior estimate of 13 million meals will be served at the Games;[94] with around 40,000 meals each day, 1,200 of those will be Michelin-starred.[96] Each day, a boulangerie will bake fresh baguettes and other breads.[98] A 3,500-seat restaurant was constructed for the Games to highlight global cuisine. Great Britain's team asked for porridge to be added to the menu, and South Korea's team asked for kimchi.[96]

Throughout the Games, various athletes and competitors at the Olympic Village complained about certain foods within the accommodation such as eggs and grilled meats not being available in sufficient quantity.[99][100] British athletes also reportedly complained about raw meat being served and the food issues led many of them to begin to avoid the Olympic Village dining facilities and to eat elsewhere; the British Olympic Association having flown in chefs to take care of the nourishment of British athletes at a location outside the Olympic Village.[101][102][103][104]

Air conditioning
In the lead-up to the Games, it was announced that the Olympic Village would lack air conditioning; as an environmental measure, the buildings would instead use a geothermal natural cooling system to keep the inside temperature 6 °C (11 °F) cooler than outside.[105] On learning this, many teams opted to supply their own air-conditioning units to the Games, including Canada, Great Britain, Italy, Germany, Greece, Denmark, Japan, and the US.[106]Olympic delegations from poorer countries, such as Uganda, complained that they could not afford to provide air conditioning for their athletes.[107]

Transportation

Over €500 million has been invested in transport improvements for the Games,[108] with extensions to the Paris Métro and 60 kilometres (37 mi) of new cycle lanes.[109][110] Visitors to Paris will pay higher public transport fares during the Games, €4 instead of the previous €2.15 price. This will pay for the increased frequency and hours of service for public transport during the Games, with an average increase of 15% in services.[108][111] As with previous Games, 185 kilometres (115 mi) of reserved traffic lanes will be used to ensure reliable journey times for athletes, officials and the media.[112]

Volunteers
The Paris 2024 volunteer platform for the Olympic and Paralympic Games was opened to the public in March 2023. There were expected to be 45,000 volunteers recruited worldwide for the Games.[113] Following the end of registration on 3 May 2023, over 300,000 applications had been submitted to the Paris Organising Committee, exceeding the number of applicants for the previous two Olympics.[114] Applicants were notified of the outcome of their application between September and December 2023.[115] Over 800 applicants were excluded over security fears, among which 15 were flagged with Fiche S.[116]

Torch relay

Two torchbearers in Carcassonne
The Olympic torch relay began with the lighting of the Olympic flame on 16 April in Olympia, Greece, 100 days before the start of the Games. Greek rower Stefanos Douskos was the first torchbearer and swimmer Laure Manaudou served as the first French torchbearer.[117][118] The latter was selected to be one of four captains of the torch relay, alongside swimmer Florent Manaudou (her brother), paratriathlete Mona Francis [fr], and para-athlete Dimitri Pavadé.[119][120] The torch relay is expected to have 10,000 torchbearers and visit over 400 settlements in 65 French territories, including six overseas.[117] On 18 May, it was reported that the portion of the relay in New Caledonia was cancelled due to ongoing unrest in the collectivity.[121]

Tickets
9.5 million of the 10 million tickets available for the games were sold. Several sports reported record attendance.[122]

The Games
Opening ceremony

The opening ceremony began at 19:30 CEST (17:30 GMT) on 26 July 2024.[123] Directed by Thomas Jolly,[124][125][126] it was the first Summer Olympics opening ceremony to be held outside the traditional stadium setting (and the second ever after the 2018 Youth Olympic Games one, held at Plaza de la República in Buenos Aires); the parade of athletes was conducted as a boat parade along the Seine from Pont d'Austerlitz to Pont d'Iéna, and cultural segments took place at various landmarks along the route.[127] Jolly stated that the ceremony would highlight notable moments in the history of France, with an overall theme of love and "shared humanity".[127] The athletes then attended the official protocol at Jardins du Trocadéro, in front of the Eiffel Tower.[128] Approximately 326,000 tickets were sold for viewing locations along the Seine, 222,000 of which were distributed primarily to the Games' volunteers, youth and low-income families, among others.[129]

The ceremony featured music performances by American musician Lady Gaga,[130] French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, heavy metal band Gojira and soprano Marina Viotti [fr],[131] Axelle Saint-Cirel (who sang the French national anthem "La Marseillaise" atop the Grand Palais),[132] rapper Rim'K,[133] Philippe Katerine (who portrayed the Greek god Dionysus), Juliette Armanet and Sofiane Pamart, and was closed by Canadian singer Céline Dion.[131] The Games were formally opened by president Emmanuel Macron.[134]

The Olympics and Paralympics cauldron was lit by Guadeloupean judoka Teddy Riner and sprinter Marie-José Pérec, has a hot air balloon-inspired design topped by a 30-metre-tall (98 ft) helium sphere; it is allowed to float into the air above the Tuileries Garden at night. For the first time, the cauldron is not illuminated through combustion; the flames are simulated by an LED lighting system and aerosol water jets.

Controversy ensued at the opening ceremony when a segment was thought to parody the Last Supper. The organisers apologised for any offence caused.[136] The Olympic World Library and fact-checkers would later debunk the interpretation that the segment was a parody of the Last Supper. The Olympic flag was also raised upside down.[137][138]

During the day of the opening ceremony, there allegedly was a blackout in Paris although this was later debunked was well.[139][140]

Sports

The disciplines of kayak cross (pictured) and kiteboarding made their debut in the core Olympic programme.

Breaking (pictured) was selected as one of four discretionary sports for the games alongside skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing.
The programme of the 2024 Summer Olympics featured 329 events in 32 sports, encompassing a total of 48 disciplines.[141] This included the 28 "core" Olympic sports contested in 2016 and 2020,[142] and 4 optional sports that were proposed by the Paris Organising Committee: breakdancing made its Olympic debut as an optional sport, while skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing returned to the programme, having debuted at the 2020 Summer Olympics.[143][144][145] Four events were dropped from weightlifting. In canoeing, two sprint events were replaced with two slalom events, keeping the overall event total at 16. In sport climbing, the previous "combined" event was divided into two separate disciplines: speed climbing, and boulder-and-lead.[146]

When Paris was bidding for the Games in August 2017, the Paris Organising Committee announced an intention to hold talks with the IOC and professional esports organisations about the possibility of introducing competitive esports events in 2024.[147][148] In July 2018, the IOC confirmed that esports would not be considered for the 2024 Olympics.[144] At the 134th IOC Session in June 2019, the IOC approved the Paris Organising Committee's proposed optional sports of breaking (breakdance), along with skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing, three sports that were first included in 2020.[149][143][144][145]

In the 2024 Paris Olympics, several new events and formats have been introduced. Formula Kite made its debut, described as the "Formula One of the Olympics", featuring high-speed foil racing with separate events for men and women.[150] Kayak cross also debuted, where four athletes race against each other on a course with multiple gates, marking the first head-to-head race in Olympic canoe slalom history. Sport climbing returned with a new format, splitting into bouldering and lead combined events in addition to a speed event. 3x3 basketball, which debuted in Tokyo, was back with finals scheduled for August 5 at Place de La Concorde. Changes in other sports included the introduction of men's participation in artistic swimming, a new women's weight class in boxing, and the addition of a marathon race walk mixed relay in track and field.[151]
